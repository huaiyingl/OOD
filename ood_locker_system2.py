Problem Statement:
Designing an Amazon Locker system involves multiple components, including user interaction for package pickup, delivery personnel interaction for package drop-off, and an optimal locker allocation mechanism. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the requirements and a high-level design for each component:

Requirements Analysis:
- User Interaction:
    - Users should receive a code to open a locker.
    - Users should be able to open the locker using the code and pick up their package.
- Delivery Personnel Interaction:
    - Delivery personnel should be able to find an optimal locker for a package.
    - Delivery personnel should be able to place the package in the locker and mark it as occupied.

High-Level Design
Components
- Locker System:
    - Manages all lockers, their statuses (occupied/free), and packages.
- User Interface:
    - For users to enter the code and open the locker.
    - For delivery personnel to find and allocate lockers.
- Backend System:
    - Manages locker allocation, code generation, and validation.
- Database:
    - Stores locker information, package details, user codes, and statuses.

## Follow up: what's the optimal locker?
## Follow up: what if we want to set up a notificaiton system?
